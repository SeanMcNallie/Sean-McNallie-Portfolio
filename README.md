# Sean McNallie Portfolio

## Description

This is the start of my ever-evolving portfolio. It was built from scratch to show my recent skills in HTML and CSS. The tabs in the Header are linked to the different sections on the page itself. The pictures are linked or will be linked to different examples of my work. It is a work in progress, but by the end of the SMU Bootcamp. It will be used to help me find a job.

I used flexbox to make it adaptable to various size screens form personal computers to mobile phones.
